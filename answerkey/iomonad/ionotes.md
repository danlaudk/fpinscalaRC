i thought this blog post with diagrams was a nicer intro than 13.3 to trampolines [Tail calls, @tailrec and trampolines](http://blog.richdougherty.com/2009/04/tail-calls-tailrec-and-trampolines.html)
i don't understand the complexity that comes with flatMap, or that defn of flatMap. Why not make thunk/resume be () => Tailrec[A] instead of () => A ??
